# Sebastian's Portfolio
Main Projects I've been working in statistics, data science and big data.

## [Project 1: Predicting Churn using Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression](https://github.com/TWM-Sebastian-S/Predicting-Churn-using-Gradient-Boosting-and-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/Predicting%20Churn%20using%20Gradient%20Boosting%20and%20Logistic%20Regression.ipynb)


### Framing the Business Problem
------
A Telecom Company has evidence of customer churn and has provided a dataset with certain information regarding their clients. Customer attrition, also known as customer churn, customer turnover, or customer defection, is the loss of clients or customers.

Why is it bad? Because revenue that was once captured by the business is no longer going to repeat. So, eventually, churn leads to increase company's efforts to acquire new clients, evetually increasing CAC (customer acquisition cost) & reducing profits. Moreover, acquiring new customers is more expensive than maintaining existing ones. The more customers you churn, the more money you must spend to regain new one that will cover the loss of business.

A good practice that most of the companies implement, is related to target potential churn customers in advance to try to see if there is space to take action beforehand. Therefore, any good CRM must have a solid prediction model to target potential loss of customers in advance.

In the following project I will work with the Telecom Company database containing information regarding their customers and churn situation.
