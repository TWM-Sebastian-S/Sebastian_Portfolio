# Sebastian's Portfolio
------
Main Projects I've been working in statistics, data science and big data.

## [Project 1: Predicting Churn using Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression](https://github.com/TWM-Sebastian-S/Predicting-Churn-using-Gradient-Boosting-and-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/README.md)

#### Extract

* Machine Learning Project in Python created to find out the key drivers that lead to churn and predict the customer churn for a Telecom Company.
* The Company has evidence of customer churn and has provided a dataset with certain information regarding their clients.
* Engineered features from the dataset to create models using multiple algorithms on Python and Scikit Learn:
*   Logistic Regression
*   GradientBoosting
* Performed Hyper-parameter tuning.
* Compare the performance of different models using multiple metrics of ROC AUC and Precision Recall Curve.
* I came up with a gradient boosting model with only the strongest features and a solid performance against Logistic Regression.

## [Project 2: Expedia Hotel Recomendations](https://github.com/TWM-Sebastian-S/Expedia-Hotel-Recomendations/blob/main/README.md)

### Extract

* Kaggle Competition where I built a Machine Learning Machine Project created to recommend hotels to Expedia's customers.
* Create models using multiple algorithms with hyperparameter tuning.
* Compare the performance of different models using jaccard_score.
* Given that all models tried were performing quite low, I tried several algorithms.
*   Random Forests
*   Naive Bayes
*   Logistic Regression
*   KNN
*   XGBoost
*   Decission Tree
* I created a function to calculate the probability to include in a basket of 5 options and that increased significantly the percentage of accuracy.
